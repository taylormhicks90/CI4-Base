# Wonderlic Test

## What is the Wonderlic Test

Created in 1936 by E. F. Wonderlic, the Wonderlic Personnel Test was the first short-form cognitive abilities test.[3][11] It was developed to measure general cognitive ability in the areas of math, vocabulary, and reasoning.[3][11] Wonderlic created and distributed it as a graduate student in the psychology department at Northwestern University from his home.[12][11] Regarding the time allotted to take the test, Wonderlic, in an article released in 1939, stated that "the length of the test was made such that only about two to five per cent of average groups complete the test in the twelve-minute time limit."[4]

Originally designed to aid in employee selection of companies such as AT&T[13] and Oscar Meyer in the 1940s, the Wonderlic Personnel Test has also been used by both the United States Armed Forces and the National Football League for selection purposes. During World War II, the Navy began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for pilot training and navigation. During this time period, 1940â€“1960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s Tom Landry, coach of the Dallas Cowboys, was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.[3] It is still used in the annual NFL Combine as a form of pre-draft assessment.[3][11] In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time. It may be termed as a quick IQ test.[14]
